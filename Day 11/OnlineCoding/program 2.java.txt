Write a java program to Count number of trailing zeros in product of array.

Description:
A simple solution is simply multiply and count trailing 0s in product. This solution may cause integer overflow. 
A better solution is based on the fact that zeros are formed by a combination of 2 and 5. 
Hence the number of zeros will depend on the number of pairs of 2’s and 5’s that can be formed.

Answer:
import java.util.*; 
import java.lang.*; 
public class Main
{ 
	public static int countZeroso(int[] a, int n) 
	{ 
		int count2 = 0, count5 = 0; 
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
		{ 
             while (a[i] % 2 == 0) 
			{ 
				a[i] = a[i] / 2; 
				count2++; 
			} 
              while (a[i] % 5 == 0) 
			{ 
				a[i] = a[i] / 5; 
				count5++; 
			} 
		} 
	  return (count2 < count5) ? count2 : count5; 
	} 
	public static void main(String argc[]) 
	{ 
		int[] a = new int[]{ 10, 100, 20, 30, 50, 91, 12, 80 }; 
		int n = 8; 
		System.out.println(countZeroso(a, n)); 
	} 
} 

Output:
8
