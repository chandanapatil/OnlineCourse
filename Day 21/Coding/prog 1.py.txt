Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.

Program:
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 
count_odd = 0
count_even = 0
for x in numbers:
        if not x % 2:
    	     count_even+=1
        else:
    	     count_odd+=1
print("Number of even numbers :",count_even)
print("Number of odd numbers :",count_odd)

Output:
Number of even numbers : 4
Number of odd numbers : 5
